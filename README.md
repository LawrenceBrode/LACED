## Abstract
### Overview of the project
**LACED** is an innovative delayering technique developed for reverse engineering modern hardware, with a focus on multilayer PCBs, using an **extremely accessible and low-cost approach**. It combines **a low-power, budget-friendly UV laser**, simple chemical solutions, and micrometer-based precision tracking — enabling advanced circuit exploration without the need for industrial tools or cleanroom environments.

Through this process, **LACED achieves precision levels between 3.5 and 10 microns**, bridging the gap between DIY and professional-grade delayering.

More than just a method, **LACED is a mindset**:

> _To prove to the world that ingenuity beats million-dollar industries._

### Project Goals

The LACED™ technique was developed with the following goals in mind:

1.  **Accessibility**  
     To enable advanced delayering and reverse engineering using only low-cost, widely available tools — without the need for industrial machinery or cleanroom environments.
    
2.  **Precision**  
     To achieve micron-level control (3.5–10 µm) in the removal of FR4 and copper layers, making it suitable for high-resolution hardware analysis.
    
3.  **Documentation**  
     To create a detailed and replicable methodology that can be adopted, improved, and shared by the maker and research communities.
    
4.  **Empowerment**  
     To prove that a single person, in a bedroom lab, can match the results of processes that normally require million-dollar setups.
    
5.  **Emotional Purpose**  
     To explore not only circuitry, but memory — by uncovering physical messages hidden between PCB layers, turning reverse engineering into an act of personal and artistic expression.

Key Results & Why It Matters
✅ Achieved physical precision between 3.5 and 10 microns, using a low-cost CNC diode laser (5W), micrometer tracking, and basic chemical etching — all performed in a home environment.

✅ Successfully exposed internal copper layers of a 6-layer PCB, proving that high-resolution delayering can be accomplished without industrial tools like FIB systems or pro-grade milling stations.

✅ Recovered a hidden message engraved between layers — showing that LACED is not only a technical method, but also a form of expression capable of revealing both data and meaning.

✅ Developed a fully documented, step-by-step methodology, reproducible with accessible equipment, allowing anyone with curiosity and discipline to explore modern hardware at micron scale.

> Why it matters:
> LACED lowers the entry barrier to advanced PCB analysis and digital preservation.
> It empowers individuals to explore, understand, and protect hardware — not with money, but with ingenuity, precision, and intent.
